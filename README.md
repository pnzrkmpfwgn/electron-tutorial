# Tutorial
Reading through electron docs and implementing tutorials, there will be separate branches for each topic

## Usage
npm install 
npm start
a window will come up after npm start which will have a path to your desktop app's exe path and path-to-app written separately. You can open a new cmd or bash to this project's directory and execute it like ====> node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe . so you can boot up the application.
